# event_updates_app
 event updates app for event management using flutter and api integration is done in it,
 build an app using Flutter that allows users to stay up-to-date with the latest events happening around them. We're fetching all the information from an API, so you can trust that the details are always accurate and up-to-date. The app has three screens, the first is the home screen where you can see all the events listed and scroll through them. When you click on search, it takes you to the second screen which is the search screen. Here you can sort the events by name and find the one you're looking for quickly. Finally, when you click on an event card listed either on the home screen or search screen, it takes you to the third screen which is the event detail screen. Here, you can see all the details of the event you selected.
